# Blender Portfolio

This is my **first frontend project**, showcasing my journey as an aspiring interior designer and 3D rendering enthusiast. The entire website was built using **native HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, without relying on frameworks or libraries.

## Project Overview

The website serves as a portfolio to highlight my 3D rendering work done in Blender. It includes sections such as:

- **Home Page**: An introduction to the website.
- **About Page**: A brief story of my journey in 3D rendering.
- **Project Highlights**: Specific projects like "Heringer Kitchen" and "Sustainable House."
- **Gallery**: Random renders that showcase my creativity.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The site is designed to adapt to different screen sizes.
- **Interactive Elements**:
  - Hamburger menu for navigation.
  - Clickable images in the gallery that expand to full-screen.
- **Custom Animations**: Smooth scrolling, dynamic transitions, and hover effects.
- **Video Integration**: Background video for added visual appeal.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the website.
- **CSS**: For styling and animations.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity, like handling scroll events and image gallery behavior.

## What I Learned

- Structuring a project from scratch with native technologies.
- Writing modular and reusable CSS.
- Implementing basic DOM manipulation and event handling with JavaScript.
- Debugging layout and design issues across different devices.

## Challenges Faced

- Creating responsive layouts without external libraries.
